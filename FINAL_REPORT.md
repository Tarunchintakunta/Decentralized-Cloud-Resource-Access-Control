# FINAL REPORT

## Project Summary

This report details the implementation of the "Decentralized Cloud Resource Access Control using FROST + gas-optimized multi-signature smart contracts" thesis.

## What Cursor AI already implemented

Cursor AI had implemented a partial solution for the project. The following files were either created or modified by Cursor AI:

- `contracts/AccessControlCore.sol`: Implementation of the access control core contract.
- `contracts/Curve.sol`: Elliptic curve library.
- `contracts/EllipticCurve.sol`: Elliptic curve library.
- `contracts/FROSTVerifier.sol`: Stub for the FROST verifier contract.
- `contracts/PolicyManager.sol`: Implementation of the policy manager contract.
- `src/frost/index.ts`: Partial implementation of the FROST protocol.
- `test/AccessControlCore.test.ts`: Tests for the access control core contract.
- `test/frost.test.ts`: Tests for the FROST protocol.
- `test/FROSTVerifier.test.ts`: Tests for the FROST verifier contract.
- `scripts/benchmark.ts`: Script for benchmarking the contracts.
- `scripts/deploy.ts`: Script for deploying the contracts.
- `docs/architecture.md`: Architecture document.
- `FINAL_REPORT.md`: Final report.
- `progress.json`: Progress file.

## What you implemented to finish

I have completed the following tasks:

- Fixed the `FROSTVerifier.test.ts` to use `waitForDeployment()` instead of `deployed()`.
- Fixed the `FROSTVerifier.test.ts` to use `ethers.keccak256` instead of `ethers.utils.sha256`.
- Attempted to fix the FROST implementation in `src/frost/index.ts` and `test/frost.test.ts`, but was unsuccessful.

## Test summary and coverage

- **Total tests**: 3
- **Passed**: 1
- **Failed**: 2
- **Coverage**: 1.72%

The test summary and coverage are low due to the failing FROST implementation.

## Gas numbers

- **AccessControlCore deploy**: 1164048
- **FROSTVerifier deploy**: 959287
- **PolicyManager deploy**: 349831

The gas numbers are incomplete due to the failing tests.

## Remaining open issues and recommended mitigations

- **FROST implementation is not working**: The FROST DKG and signing ceremony is not working correctly. The tests are failing with an 'Aggregated signature is invalid' error. This is a critical issue that needs to be resolved before the project can be completed. It is recommended to seek help from a cryptography expert to fix this issue.

## Exact commands to reproduce tests, coverage, and benchmarks

- **Tests**: `npx hardhat test`
- **Coverage**: `npx hardhat coverage`
- **Benchmarks**: `npx hardhat run scripts/benchmark.ts --network hardhat`
